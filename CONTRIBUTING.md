### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start dev server with Turbo
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm start            # Start production server

# Code Quality

pnpm format           # Auto-fix formatting issues

# Database
pnpm db:migrate       # Run migrations
pnpm db:generate      # Generate migration from schema changes
pnpm db:studio        # Open Drizzle Studio
pnpm db:push          # Push schema changes (dev only)

# Testing
pnpm test             # Run Playwright tests
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode compliance
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper typing - avoid `any` when possible
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React hooks rules
- Prefer server components by default
- Use `"use client"` directive only when needed
- Keep components small and focused

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile.tsx`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `getUserProfile`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`)

### Code Organization

```
app/                  # Next.js app router
  (auth)/            # Auth route group
  (chat)/            # Chat route group
components/          # React components
lib/                 # Core business logic
  ai/               # AI-related utilities
  db/               # Database layer
  memory/           # CEREBRO memory system
tests/              # Test files
  e2e/              # End-to-end tests
  lib/              # Unit tests
  routes/           # API route tests
```

### Comments

- Write self-documenting code first
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Use JSDoc for functions and types
- Explain "why" not "what" in comments

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Promotes a temporary memory to permanent storage.
 * This is irreversible and should only be done for validated data.
 * 
 * @param key - Unique memory identifier
 * @param actorRole - Role of the actor performing promotion
 * @returns Promise resolving to the promoted memory
 */
async function promoteMemory(key: string, actorRole: Role): Promise<Memory> {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`
- Location: `tests/lib/` for library code
- Coverage: Aim for >80% for critical paths
- Focus: Pure functions, utilities, business logic

### Integration Tests

- Location: `tests/routes/` for API routes
- Test API contracts and error handling
- Mock external dependencies

### E2E Tests

- Location: `tests/e2e/`
- Use Playwright
- Test critical user flows
- Keep tests fast and reliable

### Testing Best Practices

- Write descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- One assertion per test when possible
- Mock external services
- Use factories for test data
- Clean up after tests
