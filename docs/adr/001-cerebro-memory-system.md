# ADR-001: Use CEREBRO for Memory Management

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AI chat applications need a robust memory system to maintain context across conversations and provide personalized experiences.

## Decision
Implement the CEREBRO memory management system with three-tier hierarchy, RBAC, encryption, audit trails, caching, and RAG integration.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Structured memory management with clear tiers
- Built-in security (RBAC, encryption, audit)
- High performance with multi-level caching
- Production-ready with auto-tuning
- Comprehensive observability

### Negative
- Added architectural complexity
- Learning curve for developers
- Additional infrastructure requirements
- Higher hosting costs

## Alternatives Considered
- Simple database tables: Rejected due to lack of structure
- External vector DB: Rejected due to vendor lock-in
- Redis-only: Rejected due to reliability concerns
