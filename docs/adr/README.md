# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the minicontratos-mini project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document important architectural decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. They help:
- Track the reasoning behind technical choices
- Provide context for new team members
- Record trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Support future decision-making

## Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:
- **Title**: Short, descriptive name
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: Why the decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: Positive, negative, and neutral impacts
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy the template: `000-template.md`
2. Number sequentially: `00X-descriptive-name.md`
3. Fill in all sections
4. Submit for review via pull request
5. Update status when accepted
