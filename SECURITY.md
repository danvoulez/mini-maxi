# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 3.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by email to: [security contact - add your email here]

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- NextAuth.js 5.0 with secure session handling
- Password hashing using bcrypt-ts
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via CEREBRO system
- Server-side session validation on all protected routes

### Data Protection
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- Selective encryption based on data sensitivity levels (PII, Secret, Confidential, Public)
- KMS integration ready for production key management
- Database encryption at rest (provider-dependent)

### API Security
- Input validation using Zod schemas on all API endpoints
- CSRF protection via NextAuth
- Rate limiting (recommended to implement at edge/reverse proxy)
- Security headers via middleware:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`

### Database Security
- SQL injection prevention via Drizzle ORM parameterized queries
- Connection pooling with secure credential handling
- Audit trail (append-only) for all memory operations
- Database backups (configure in production)

### Infrastructure Security
- Environment variable validation
- Secrets management via environment variables
- No secrets in codebase
- Secure defaults for all configurations

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Rotate all default secrets (AUTH_SECRET, KMS keys)
- [ ] Enable database connection SSL
- [ ] Configure Redis with authentication (if used)
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Enable database audit logs
- [ ] Configure rate limiting at edge/reverse proxy
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only (enforced by Vercel by default)
- [ ] Review and restrict CORS policies
- [ ] Set up dependency scanning (Dependabot/Snyk)
- [ ] Configure Web Application Firewall (WAF) if available
- [ ] Enable DDoS protection
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection system (IDS)

### Environment Variables
Keep these variables secure and never commit them:
- `AUTH_SECRET` - Rotate every 90 days
- `POSTGRES_URL` - Contains database credentials
- `REDIS_URL` - Contains Redis credentials (if used)
- `KMS_KEY_*` - Encryption keys for sensitive data
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - AI service credentials
- `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` - Gateway credentials

## Known Security Considerations

### Memory System (CEREBRO)
- Memory data is encrypted based on sensitivity level
- Audit trail maintains history of all operations
- Access control enforced via RBAC
- Token budget limits prevent excessive resource usage

### AI Integration
- AI responses are not guaranteed to be safe - implement output filtering
- User inputs are validated but AI may generate unexpected content
- Implement content moderation for production use
- Monitor AI usage for abuse patterns

### External Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Vulnerability scanning recommended
- Review dependency licenses for compliance

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as needed and announced via:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- CHANGELOG.md

## Compliance

This application implements security controls aligned with:
- OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
- CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles (data encryption, audit trails)
